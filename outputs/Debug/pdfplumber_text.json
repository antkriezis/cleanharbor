Inventory Hazardous Material (IHM)
4 EUROPEAN REGULATION ON SHIP RECYCLING
4.1 INTRODUCTION
The objective of the Regulation, formally adopted on 22 October 2013 from the European Parliament on ship
recycling, is to reduce the negative impacts linked to the recycling of EU- flagged ships, especially in South Asia,
without creating unnecessary economic burdens.
The new Ship Recycling Regulation will apply to large commercial seagoing vessels flying the flag of the EU Member
State, and to ships flying the flag of the third country calling at EU ports or anchorages.
According to the new rules, the installation or use of certain hazardous materials on ships will be prohibited or
restricted. These hazardous materials include asbestos, ozone- depleting substances, PCBs, PFOS, and anti-
fouling compounds and systems. Each new European ship (or a ship flying a flag of the third country calling at EU
port or anchorage) will be required to have on board an inventory of hazardous materials verified by the relevant
Administration or authority and specifying the location and approximate quantities of those materials.
European ship owners will have to ensure that ships are only recycled in ship recycling facilities included in the
European List. They will also have to ensure that each end-of-life ship is prepared for recycling. To be included in
the European list, ship recycling facilities will be required to operate in permanent structures, which must be
designed, constructed and operated safely and respecting the environment. The recycling facilities should confine
hazardous materials throughout the dismantling process and manipulate the same only on impermeable soils with
an effective drainage system. The quantities of hazardous materials shall be documented and their treatment will
be allowed only in specific authorized treatment facilities.
On 19 December 2016, the European Commission adopted the first version of the European List of ship recycling
facilities. The first 18 shipyards included in the List are all located in the EU. They fulfil the strict requirements for
inclusion in the List and as a result will have exclusive access to the recycling of ships flying the flags of Member
States of the Union. The European Commission has also received applications from yards located in third countries.
The applications are being thoroughly reviewed and site inspections will be conducted to check their credentials.
The Commission decided in 2017 on their inclusion in the List.
The new EU Regulation (see Annex [3]) brings into force an early implementation of the requirements of the 2009
Hong Kong Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (see Annex [1]), therefore
contributing to its global entry into force.
4.2 OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTORY OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
The objectives of the Inventory, to be developed in accordance to IMO resolution MEPC.269(68) (see Annex [2]
“2015 Guidelines for the development of the Inventory of Hazardous Materials”), are to provide ship-specific
information on the actual Hazardous Materials present on board, in order to protect health and safety and to prevent
environmental pollution at Ship Recycling Facilities.
This information will be used also by the Ship Recycling Facilities in order to decide how to manage the types and
amounts of materials identified in the Inventory.
4.3 SCOPE OF THE INVENTORY
The Inventory consists of the following Parts:
✓ Part I: Materials contained in ship structure or equipment:
• Paints and coating systems containing hazardous materials;
• Equipment and machinery containing hazardous materials;
• Structure and hull containing hazardous materials.
✓ Part II: operationally generated waste.
✓ Part III: Stores:
• Stores;
• Liquids sealed in ship's machinery and equipment;
• Gases sealed in ship's machinery and equipment;
• Regular consumable goods potentially containing Hazardous Materials.
Technical Report N° 200618/D1 Page 6

Inventory Hazardous Material (IHM)
4.4 MATERIALS TO BE LISTED IN THE INVENTORY
Appendix 1 of the IMO Guidelines, "Items to be listed in the Inventory of Hazardous Materials", provides information
on the Hazardous Materials that may be found on board a ship.
Materials set out in Appendix 1 should be listed in the Inventory. Each item in Appendix 1 of these Guidelines is
classified under "Table A", "Table B", "Table C" or "Table D" according to its properties:
✓ Table A comprises the materials listed in appendix 1 of the Convention;
✓ Table B comprises the materials listed in appendix 2 of the Convention;
✓ Table C (Potentially hazardous items) comprises items which are potentially hazardous to the environment and
human health at Ship Recycling Facilities; and
✓ Table D (Regular Consumable Goods potentially containing Hazardous Materials) comprises goods which are
not integral to a ship and are unlikely to be dismantled or treated at a Ship Recycling Facility.
Table A and Table B correspond to Part I of the Inventory. Table C corresponds to Parts II and III, while Table D
corresponds to Part III.
4.5 MATERIALS NOT REQUIRED TO BE LISTED IN THE INVENTORY
IMO Resolution MEPC.269(68) provides two different methodologies for the development of the Inventory:
✓ "new ship" methodology;
✓ "existing ship" methodology.
The "new ship" methodology includes the research and inclusion in the Inventory of the totality of the substances
listed in Table A and Table B of Appendix 1, while the "existing ship" methodology requires only the research of the
substances listed table A and, as far as practicable, the research and inclusion of the substances listed in table B.
The difference between the “new ship” and “existing ship” methodology is not only limited to the considered
hazardous substances but also affects the way of collecting such information.
4.6 DEVELOPMENT OF PART I OF THE INVENTORY (“EXISTING SHIP”
METHODOLOGY)
The development of Part I of the inventory of hazardous substances is a complex process requiring close
collaboration between the persons in charge for its development, the owner/shipping company, the shipyard where
the ship was built, the manufacturers of the equipment installed on board and last but not least the crew of the ship
(if applicable).
The difficulty in obtaining the necessary information for the development of the inventory, the necessity to perform
a detailed analysis of the available documentation, contact suppliers/subcontractors, schedule visits on board, take
samples and have them analysed, may result in a very time consuming activity.
According to IMO Resolution MEPC.269(68), the development of Part I of the Inventory for an existing ship, has to
include the following steps:
✓ Step 1: Collection of necessary information;
✓ Step 2: Assessment of collected information;
✓ Step 3: Preparation of visual/sampling check plan;
✓ Step 4: Onboard visual/sampling check; and
✓ Step 5: Preparation of Part I of the Inventory and related documentation.
4.6.1 Collection of necessary information
The persons in charge for the development of the Inventory should identify, research, request and procure all
reasonably available documentation regarding the ship.
Information that will be useful includes maintenance, conversion, and repair documents; certificates, manuals, ship's
plans, drawings, and technical specifications; product information data sheets (such as Material Declarations); and
hazardous material inventories or recycling information from sister ships.
Potential sources of information could include previous shipowners, the ship builder, historical societies,
classification society records, and ship recycling facilities with experience working with similar ships
Technical Report N° 200618/D1 Page 7

--- PAGE 8 ---
Inventory Hazardous Material (IHM)
It is impossible to check all equipment, systems, and/or areas on board the ship to determine the presence or
absence of Hazardous Materials. The total number of parts on board may exceed several thousand.
In order to take a practical approach, an "Indicative list" should be prepared that identifies the equipment, system,
and/or area on board that is presumed to contain Hazardous Materials. Field interviews with the shipyard and
suppliers may be necessary to prepare such lists.
IMO Resolution MEPC.269(68) provides, for every hazardous material listed in Table A and B, an “indicative list” of
systems, equipment and structure potentially containing such substances.
4.6.2 Assessment of collected information
The information collected in the step above should be assessed. The assessment should cover all materials listed
in Table A; materials listed in Table B should be listed as far as practicable. The results of the assessment should
be reflected in the visual/sampling check plan.
Preparation of a checklist is an efficient method for developing the Inventory for existing ships in order to clarify the
results of each step.
Based on collected information including the "Indicative list" mentioned above, all equipment, systems, and/or areas
onboard assumed as containing, not containing or potentially containing Hazardous Materials listed in Tables A and
B should be included in the checklist.
Each listed equipment, system, and/or area should be then analyzed and assessed onboard for evaluating its
effective Hazardous Materials content.
4.6.3 Preparation of visual/sampling check plan
Each item classified as "Containing" or "Not containing" hazardous materials should be subjected to a visual check
on board.
For each item categorized as "unknown", a decision should be made as to whether to apply a sampling check.
However, any item categorized as "unknown" may be classed as "potentially containing Hazardous Material"
provided comprehensive justification is given, or if it can be assumed that there will be little or no effect on
disassembly as a unit and later ship recycling and disposal operations.
A “visual/sampling check plan” should be prepared on the basis of the above mentioned decisions.
In the VSCP are listed:
• Samples collected on board
• Machinery and equipment Visual Checks
All Documentary Checks are listed in the “Collection of necessary information” (ANNEX 5).
4.6.4 Onboard visual/sampling check
The visual/sampling check should be conducted according to the plan. Check points should be marked in the ship's
plan or recorded with photographs.
A person taking samples should be protected by the appropriate safety equipment relevant to the suspected type
of hazardous materials encountered. The personnel taking samples should ensure compliance with relevant
national regulations.
The results of visual/sampling checks should be recorded in the checklist. Any equipment, systems and/or areas of
the ship that cannot be accessed for checks should be classified as "potentially containing Hazardous Material" -
PCHM.
4.6.5 Development of Part I of the Inventory
The results of the check and the estimated quantity of Hazardous Materials should be recorded on the checklist.
Part I of the Inventory should be developed with reference to the checklist.

5.2 REMARKS AND LIMITATIONS
In applying the methodology described in the previous sections to the case of the MV EUROFERRY OLYMPIA, all
the prescribed steps for the development of Part I of the inventory have been followed, starting from the analysis of
the available documentation to the on board visual and sampling check (carried out by SIGE MARINE).
With reference to the documents review, useful information has been found in certificates and reports related to
construction.
This document contains an estimation of the hazardous materials quantity present onboard at the time of the visual
and sampling inspection, on the basis of the documents review previously described.
Considering the difficulty to pick up the samples in a new ship in the no destructive way and data on board of
potentially dangerous substances, the information contained herein represents the best that can be done at the
evidence available.
5.3 I-1 PAINTS AND COATING SYSTEMS CONTAINING MATERIALS LISTED
IN TABLE A AND TABLE B OF APPENDIX 1 OF THE GUIDELINES
As stated in the International Anti-fouling System Certificate (see Annex [7]), the anti-fouling system on the ship
complies with the applicable requirements of Annex 1 to the Convention.
Therefore the presence of organotin compounds in the anti-fouling system can be excluded (see Record of Anti-
fouling System: TBT free anti-fouling system).
